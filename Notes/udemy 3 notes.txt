Building works section:
z pattern using grid of col 2
like wise 3steps

tint and shade generator:
open color:
color constract checker
websites for shades

before,after - cannot be used on images
can't add childs to images

z-index:
to set one by one
to appear top
-1 :below the image

centering technique:
top:50%
left:50%
transform: translate(-50,-50);
position:absolute

to find height trick:
width:60%
padding-bottom:60%

i.e 60% of parents width

card - adding a box shadow
overflow: hidden

list-style:none(list)
text-decoration:none(link)

if added border in visited state:
border-bottom: 1px solid color
can also animate using'
transition property

now wanna remove it from the hover state
here 1px border exist so layout jumps
to fix that:
border-bottom: none(doesn't work)
border-bottom: 1px solid transparent(works)

card hover:
elementofcard:hover{
transform: translate(2rem,2rem)
[x-axis dir]
}
[moves in right down direction]
transform: translateY(2rem)
[moves in down direction]
transform: translateY(-2rem,2rem)

animation:
use a transition property on original state


Building testimonials section:
figure: self content with caption
&mdash - (-) htrml entity

adding the gallery:
if want hover effect on images
better to add it inside a container element
<figure> is best container for images

observe the space inbetween images
reason: image is a inline element
make it block to resolve this
[display:block;]

creating a grid for 12 images
and make them width of 100%
which will make them flexible

grid trick for width:
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr[normal]
grid-template-columns: 55fr 45fr[takes more than 50% width]

hover effect on grid images:
.class img:hover{
transform:scale(1.1)
}

make sure u add transition property to 
original state i.e to img
.class img{
transition: all 0.3s;
}

note: here images overflow the grid
if inspected closely
fix it by:
overflow:hidden
include it in figure element class

building pricing section:
1 rem = 16px


features section:
.grid: last-child{

margin-bottom:9.6rem;
}


building call to action section:
inherit: keyword 
eg: font-family


*:focus{
outline:none;
box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.8rem color;

default formatting for address element is italic
solve:
font-style:normal;

Responsinve website:

Media Queries-

@media(max-width:600px);
i.e is width<= 600px ?

conflicts will arise during 
same fundamentals applied at diff widths


selecting breakpoints:
viewport width/pixel value in media query

1. based on device width(poor)

2. based on screen with ranges(better)
  mobile - (300px - 500px)
  tablets -(600px-900px)
  laptops -(>1200px)

3. based on design breaks down(best)


webpage design responsive:
meta tag - important

rem and em - don't depend on html font-size
in media queries, instead, 1rem = 1em = 16px
